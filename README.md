Welcome to ReHacked!  The Redux Basics lab builds on top of the the original web application we built in [ReHacked: SPA Basics](https://github.com/reactjstampabay/rehacked-spa-basics-solution-set). 

By the end of this lab, you will have:

* Expanded upon the original project's `package.json` with `dev` and `build` scripts
* Have environmentally aware Webpack configurations
* Installed [Redux](https://github.com/gaearon/redux), [redux-thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk), [redux-logger](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-logger)
* Created Actions, Reducers, and a Store for use with the application
* Decomposed the original web app into Containers and Components
* Connected the original web app's routines to Redux
* Installed Redux DevTools to enhance local development experience

This `master` branch represents a completed solution set for the lab.  We have separated the lab into logical "breakpoints" by use of branches.  Please see below how to start.
