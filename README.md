# ReHacked (July 27, 2016): Redux Basics
### By [ReactJS Tampa Bay](http://www.meetup.com/ReactJS-Tampa-Bay/)

Welcome to ReHacked!  The Redux Basics lab builds on top of the the original web application we built in [ReHacked: SPA Basics](https://github.com/reactjstampabay/rehacked-spa-basics-solution-set). 

By the end of this lab, you will have:

* Expanded upon the original project's `package.json` with `dev` and `build` scripts
* Created a `webpack.production.config.js` for use in deployment scenarios
* Installed Redux, Redux Thunk, Redux Logger
* Created Actions, Reducers, and a Store for use with the application
* Decomposed the original web app into Containers and Components
* Connected the original web app's routines to the Redux app
