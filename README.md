# [When We Last Left Off]...(https://github.com/reactjstampabay/rehacked-redux-basics/compare/step-1...step-2)

# Goals

1. Create a **Store** for our app, which glues React to the **Actions** and **Reducers**
1. Consider Our UI Architecture in Terms of **Containers** and **Components**
1. Create an App **Container**
1. Refactor Dashboard and StartScreen to be **Containers** and Use Redux
